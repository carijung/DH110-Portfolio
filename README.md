# Title of Portfolio
Cari Jung • DH110 UX+UI design • Fall 2022

### Design statement
The UN Environmental Programme website is a highly resourceful envioronment-advocating site that aims to build a liason between humans and nature. It provides information about their mission to protect our ecosystem through combinations of articles, videos, informational pages, and resources for users to get involved. 

I believe the user interface(UI) of the UNEP website can overwhelm users, especially first time users, due to their extensive information. I believe redesigning the UI by restructuring the navigation bars and the flow can make the site more approachable and help users locate specific informations on sustainable communites more efficiently. Also, I hope to improve the limitations in user control and freedom present in signing up for updates and no autofill suggestions in search bars.

### Research
I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the UN Environment Programme website to understand the current ux issue of the website related to the topic.

### Design
First I created three personas and scenarios.

Next, using the personas, I created a low fidelity prototype.
