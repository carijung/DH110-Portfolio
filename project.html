        <H5 class="font-weight-normal pl-2" >Over the course of eight weeks,  I accomplished six milestones to redesign the UN Environment Programme website by adding features, redesigning the UI to bring out hidden features and information that users can miss, and also establish intuitive interactions. The UNEP website houses various resources like publications on environmental works being done, environmental goals they are striving to achieve by 2030, and opportunities users can take to ameliorate the pressing issues that can damage our future. </H5>
        
        <H3 class="font-weight-normal pt-4" >Design Statement</H3>
        <hr class="mx-2" />
        <H5 class="font-weight-normal pl-2" >  Since everyone is can make an impact to secure a sustainable future for our future generations, the UNEP site should be globally communicable and accessible to both technical novices and experts. My goal is to help the UNEP website create a liaison between users of every demographic who acquire different technical skills and our environment by enhancing interactivity and accessibility of the site. Whether the user's purpose of engaging with this site is for academic research or the desire to learn more about the environment, they should be able to reach their goal without encountering obstacles.
        <br>
        <br>
        After conducting the usability testing and user research, I found that the users indeed found the menus in the navigation bar vague and the overall flow to achieve their end goal overwhelming. Also, key informations seem to be hidden away. Therefore, these features need to be redesigned to make the information immediately visible. </H5>

                    <p class="card-text">I conducted a pilot usability testing (UT) to gain an understanding of how users interact with the UNEP website and to test the accessibility. The goal was to monitor how the user obtained specific information when instructed to do so. Therefore, I asked the user to complete three tasks I have created:</p>
                    <p class="card-text mx-5"> 1) Look for sustainability goals</p>
                    <p class="card-text mx-5"> 2) Subscribe to newsletters</p>

                    <p class="card-text">

My user was a Korean speaker who is interested in learning more about sustainability but is a technical novice. Therefore, I conducted my usability testing in Korean. I found that it is difficult to look for or navigate to resources because of vagueness, existing jargon, and features that seem to be hidden away.

                    It was a meaningful process that takes various possibilities into account like visual impairments, readability, legibility, etc. </p>

           <p class = "p-2">The objective of this high-fidelity prototype is to provide a highly functional and interactive representation of the UNEP website and to see how the features influence the user's choice and performance. Ultimately, I chose to create a prototype based on task 1 and 3. I changed the frames from the low fidelity prototype to fit a cellular device since there are more users who have access to a cellphone than a laptop or computer. I used the prototyping features in Figma to make components such as buttons, scroll bars, and the hamburger menu clickable and scrollable to allow clicking/scrolling to increment to the next page or display an overlay. A cognitive walkthrough was also conducted and changes were made to improve the design. </p>

        <hr/>
        <p class = "p-2">I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with two of my peers in Digital Humanities 110. This process took 15 minutes and they performed two tasks: creating their own data and accessing information about sustainability. While conducting each task, they gave their impression and thoughts about the high fidelity prototype. Based on the feedback, I restructured the flow of the navigation bar so that when a user clicks "The Environment", instead of showing a laundry list of menus, it leads them to a separate page that displays all the options. I changed the navigation menu names from vague titles like "What we do" to "The Environment". Furthermore, I've decided to make changes to the font size, color saturation, and contrast.

         <hr/>
           <p class = "p-2"> This is my first design project and throughout the eight weeks of reiterating the UX design process, I've learned that there is no such thing as a complete product as it could always be redesigned to improve user interaction. I discovered the importance of acquiring empathy and communication skills since I must understand the user and the client in order to help them achieve their vision. Amongst the many takeaways I got from this project, some include: 
               <br>
               <br>
               <b>Tradeoffs:</b> Sometimes it is necessary to remove elements in order to not make users to feel confused or overwhelmed. For instance, I only included necessary information in the footer of the UNEP website instead of maintaining the original wordy footer. 
               <br>
            
               <b>Interface design:</b> Designing is more than making the product look aesthetic. I learned to account for readability by selecting color schemes that pass the color contrast ratio (4.5:1). This is significant as the potential users may have visual impairments. 
               <br>
               <b>User research:</b> This can be a lengthy process as 
               I am trying to grasp a complete picture of users. Therefore, maintaining patience, positivity, and understanding that users' frustration is also part of the user research process is key.  
               <br>
               <br>
               Moreover, this was a meaningful experience as I got to work on catering a digital product to almost every demographic by making it more accessible. As I improve my design thinking and take on more case studies, I look forward to collborating with other designers in the future.
